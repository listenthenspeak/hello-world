# hello-world
Tradition dictates the hello world element in all beginnings of things tech.  Here I am beginning a new life. a birth of knowledge about this ever so fascinating world.

Going forward I'd like to contribute to projects that are bigger than just myself.  One of my first jobs was in a restaurant where I was the dishwasher.  That's typically a role that no one wants to do.  It also reserved for newbies in the culinary world.  Consider me your dishwasher...for the time being.

Hereâ€™s what I just accomplished in this tutorial:

Created an open source repository
Started and managed a new branch
Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
Opened and merged a Pull Request

Nice.
