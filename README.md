# hello-world
Tradition dictates the hello world element in all beginnings of things tech.  Here I am beginning a new life. a birth of knowledge about this ever so fascinating world.

Going forward I'd like to contribute to projects that are bigger than just myself.  One of my first jobs was in a restaurant where I was the dishwasher.  That's typically a role that no one wants to do.  It also reserved for newbies in the culinary world.  Consider me your dishwasher...for the time being.
